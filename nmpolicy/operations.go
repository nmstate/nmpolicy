// GenerateState creates a NMPolicy state based on the given input data:
// - NMPolicy spec.
// - NMState state, representing a given current state.
// - Cache state which includes (already resolved) named captures.

// GenerateState returns a generated state which includes:
// - Desired State: The NMState state which has been built by the policy.
// - Cache: Named NMState states which have been resolved by the policy.
//          Can be saved for use as cache data (passed as input).
// - Meta Info: Extended information about the generated state (e.g. the policy version).
//
// On failure, an error is returned.
