The NMPolicy project can be used as a CLI calling the `nmstatectl` command after
installing it. 

## Installation

To install `nmpolicyctl` you need the [go](https://go.dev/doc/install) command at your system and run 
the following command:

```bash
go install github.com/nmstate/nmpolicy
```

## Usage with `nmstatectl`

Normally the `nmpolicyctl` command will be execute side by side with the cli 
from [nmstate](https://nmstate.io) `nmstatectl`:

```bash
nmstatectl show | nmpolicyctl gen policy.yaml | nmstatectl apply
```

The `nmpolicyctl` command will output the generated desired state 
like the one at the first [example](/nmpolicy/examples.html#generated-state).

It will dump by default the [captured states](/nmpolicy/examples.html#captured-states)
to `~/.cache/nmpolicy/cache.yaml`
